Since we are still working on the functionality of the game, we cannot implement the save and load 
functionality until after we have the full game running. Since we have to produce a demo with save
and load functionality implemented in this iteration, we decided to write a simple GUI to show how 
we will be implementing the save and load functionality in the actual game.
