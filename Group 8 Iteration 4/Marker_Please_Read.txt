There is only 2 and 4 player game with actual players implemented, so please choose that option.
As we counldn't implement the AI version of the game.

Before every turn please click on an availaible domino in the middle grid, and then pick 2 squares
on the player grid, to place the tiles. The sequence in which these tiles are clicked determine the 
order.

King Figures are represented by the border around the middle gird tiles.

End game (points calculation) is also incomplete.

Load and save buttons are also not complete.

We tired to address the Color Deficiency by allowing users to make colors of their choice.
